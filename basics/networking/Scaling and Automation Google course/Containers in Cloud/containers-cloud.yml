objectives:
  - Define the concept of a container and identify uses for containers.
  - Identify the purpose of and use cases for Kubernetes and Google Kubernetes Engine GKE
  - Identify the purpose of hybrid and multi-cloud computing with Anthos.

Compute Engine IaaS:
  - each developer with own OS, access to HW, build app in self contained env
  - It is configurable system but costly deploy for small apps

App Engine PaaS:
  - Only Code and automatic scale up or down
  - but no fine tune

Containers: scales like a PaaS with nearly the flexibility of a IaaS
  - box around code, the code is ultra portable as we see OS and HW as a black box, we can move it from the laptop to Cloud with no changes at all
  - limited access to its own partition of the filesystem and HW
  - start as quickly as a process
  - Only needs in each Host OS a kernel supporting containers and a container runtime
  - using network connections we can make them interconnect across a set of hosts
